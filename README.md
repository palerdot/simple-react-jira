## Simple React JIRA

Simple JIRA like ticketing app built with React/Redux/React Router

## Setting up

This project is bootstrapped with `create-react-app`. Please make sure you have **latest node** (preferable 6+)

### Hosting

This app is hosted statically in heroku here - https://simple-react-jira.herokuapp.com/

It is done by doing this simple trick of mimicking a php app as mentioned in https://gist.github.com/wh1tney/2ad13aa5fbdd83f6a489


```javascript
// install dependencies
yarn install
// start the dev server
yarn start
// you can also make a production build and run the stuff inside the build folder

// to run the tests
yarn test
```
